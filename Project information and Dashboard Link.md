## Dashboard Features
The dashboard is divided into four main sections, each offering a distinct analytical perspective to aid in the decision-making process.

**1. Demographic View**
Objective: Understand the distribution of customers across various demographic segments.
Insights: This view breaks down the customer base by key factors such as age, gender, and geographical location (cities). The analysis reveals patterns in credit card usage preferences based on these demographic groups. For example, younger customers may show a preference for cards with lifestyle benefits, while customers in certain cities may exhibit higher spending power.

**2. Expenditure Analysis**
Objective: Explore spending behavior across various categories.
Insights: This view highlights customers' spending trends in areas such as online shopping, utilities, travel, entertainment, and essential services. It identifies the highest spend categories, which could inform the design of reward systems and cashback incentives.
Value: By understanding where customers spend the most, Mitron Bank can structure credit card benefits that are aligned with customer habits, increasing the likelihood of card usage.


**3. Income Analysis**
Objective: Evaluate customer income levels and their correlation with spending capacity.
Insights: This view categorizes customers into income brackets and assesses their purchasing power. It explores how income levels affect spending patterns and credit card utilization.
Value: The insights provide data-driven recommendations on how to structure tiered credit card options for high-income, mid-income, and low-income groups.


**4. Income Utilization View**
Objective: Assess income-to-expenditure ratios for creditworthiness evaluation.
Insights: This view helps identify customers with sustainable debt-to-income ratios, allowing Mitron Bank to target financially stable individuals with higher credit limits, while also identifying potential risk areas.
